The design of this gun is based on a German Messerschmitt Bf 109E anti-submarine flotilla, which saw service as Luftwaffe fighter squadrons from 1944 to 1945.

He also said he would welcome discussion about whether his administration was pursuing policies towards Russia which could have an impact upon Nato membership. UK secretary general Theresa May spoke out again before she left London earlier this week after Mr Trump signed two executive orders imposing new sanctions across Europe aimed specifically squarely toward Moscow over Crimea, Syria air strikes and cyber attacks targeting western governments. She has now called such action by Washington-friendly European leaders 'uncalled up'. Despite strong criticism from many quarters including her Labour party base, Mrs Merkel is expected eventually go along with more formalised calls within Brussels following both major elections next year.

What are these? 5)...I respect democracy ..we must allow people to decide what they think..that sounds right!"
